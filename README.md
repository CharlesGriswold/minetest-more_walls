Tired of always using the same three walls? This mod adds no fewer than 42 new walls!

This mod adds a bunch of new walls. The new wall types are: Acacia 
Tree, Acacia Wood, Apple Tree, Aspen Tree, Aspen Wood, Bronze, Brown

## How to use it

Rename the directory to `more_walls` (Minetest doesn't like dashes), 
copy it to your mods directory, and enable it in the main Minetest 
menu. The recipes are similar to the vanilla wall recipes, but with 
different materials.
